In the fiercely competitive e-commerce landscape, understanding the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is paramount for businesses aiming for sustained growth and profitability. With the rising cost of acquiring new customers and the significant benefits of retaining existing ones, e-commerce companies must identify and invest in high-value customers to maximize profitability. The challenge lies in accurately forecasting the future value of customers from diverse segments, considering the dynamic nature of consumer behavior and market conditions. The escalating customers’ expectations further necessitate personalized marketing strategies and continuous innovation in product offerings. In this light, CLV is a powerful marking measure and a financial improvement tool for any company (Gupta and Zeithaml, 2006). Historical CLV offers a retrospective view of customer behavior over time. E-commerce businesses can gain deeper insights into customer preferences, tendencies, and lifetime value evolution by analyzing past purchasing patterns, trends, and interactions. This understanding forms the foundation for informed decision-making and strategic planning. In conjunction with that, segmentation allows businesses to tailor their marketing efforts to different customer groups effectively. Therefore, segmentation based on CLV empowers e-commerce businesses to identify high-value customer segments that warrant specialized marketing campaigns. The project is driven by the critical need for e-commerce businesses to leverage data analytics for informed decision-making. Through an in-depth analysis of CLV segmentation techniques and their practical applications, we aim to provide valuable insights into how businesses can effectively leverage CLV to drive growth and achieve competitive advantage in the market. In this paper, CLV is calculated using the following formula:<br />
CLV = Customer Value * Average Customer Lifespan <br />
● Customer Value = Average Purchase Value * Average Frequency Rate <br />
➢ Average Purchase Value = Total Revenue over a time frame / Total number of purchases over the same time frame <br />
➢ Average Frequency Rate = Total number of purchases over a period / Total number of customers during the same period <br />
● Average Customer Lifespan = Average number of days customers stay active / Total number of customers <br />

Business Questions:<br />
- Which customers will generate the highest profits for multi-category e-commerce companies? <br />
- What is the best machine learning (ML) technique for customer segmentation in E-commerce? <br />
- How can the analysis and modeling results be used for effective marketing strategies? <br />
Our first objective is to optimize marketing spend by focusing on high-value customers. This means identifying and targeting customers who have the potential to generate revenue for our business. Moreover, we recognize the importance of nurturing long-term relationships with our customers and keeping them engaged with our brand. By understanding their preferences, behaviors, and needs, we can tailor our marketing messages and offers to resonate with each customer individually. Therefore, our second objective is to enhance customer retention through personalized marketing strategies. To accomplish such goals, we will begin by profiling our customers based on their behaviors, demographic information, and preferences. Next, we will determine the most effective method by using parametric and non-parametric techniques for classifying customer segments for our e-commerce business.
In this report, we present the results of our analysis aimed at understanding customer segmentation and behavior in our e-commerce business. Through the application of cluster analysis, we have identified three distinct customer segments: Premium, Gold, and Silver. These segments exhibit varying levels of engagement, spending habits, and geographic distribution. Additionally, our analysis highlights the effectiveness of the Random Forest algorithm in accurately classifying customers and identifies key factors influencing segmentation. These insights provide valuable opportunities for targeted marketing, personalized experiences, and strategic decision-making to drive business growth and customer satisfaction.
